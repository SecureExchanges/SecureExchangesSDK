# Secure Exchanges SDK

Secure Exchanges allows you to send confidential information.

A Microsoft Outlook connector exists to allow our users to have a completely transparent experience.

We have also made available to them an SDK available in Nuget at the following address https://www.nuget.org/packages/SecureExchanges/

To use our SDK you need a user license or a trial version license.

In the code examples you will find how:

- Sent a message with attachments
- Protected with a password, SMS code or both
- To be able to read a received message
- To be able to see the logs and status of a sent message
